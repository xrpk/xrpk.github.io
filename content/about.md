Hi! I'm **Ryan Krell**, a Computer Science major and Business minor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE). I’m currently working as an **IT Infrastructure Intern** at Energizer Holdings, where I help support and optimize enterprise systems.

I’m passionate about building clean, efficient, and impactful technology. I enjoy working on projects that intersect infrastructure, automation, and real-world business needs.

In my free time, I like diving into systems programming, contributing to open source, and exploring emerging technologies like cloud-native infrastructure and AI tooling.

Feel free to check out my [Projects](/projects/) or [Resume](../RyanKrell.pdf).
