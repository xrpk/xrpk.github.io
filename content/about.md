Hi! I'm **Ryan Krell**, a Computer Science major and Business minor at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville (SIUE). I’m currently working as an **IT Infrastructure Intern** at Energizer Holdings, where I help support and optimize company security systems.

I’m passionate about almost anything in the technolgy space. I like to work with people, and I enjoy working on projects that intersect infrastructure and real-world business needs.

In my free time, I like diving into systems programming and exploring emerging technologies like cloud-native infrastructure and AI. When I am not at a computer, I like to work out and play volleyball. I currently play for the SIUE Men's Volleyball Club Team

Feel free to check out my [Projects](/projects/) or [Resume](../RyanKrell.pdf).
